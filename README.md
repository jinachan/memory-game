## Description
This is a memory card game in which the player clicks or taps cards to flip them over and reveal the symbol. There are two cards with each symbol in the game. The player wins once all cards have successfully been matched.

The game displays a star rating (from 1 to 3) that reflects the player's performance. At the beginning of a game, it displays 3 stars. As the player makes moves, the number of stars decreases.

When the player starts a game, a timer begins. Once the player wins the game, the timer stops.

When a user wins the game, a modal appears to congratulate the player and ask if they want to play again. It also shows how much time it took to win the game, and what the star rating was.

A restart button allows the player to reset the deck of cards, the timer, and the star rating.


## Dependencies
The game uses Font Awesome for icons and Google Fonts for text.
